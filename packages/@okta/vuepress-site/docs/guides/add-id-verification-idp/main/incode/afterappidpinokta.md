## Create an Okta account management policy rule

Use the [Policies API](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Policy/#tag/Policy/operation/createPolicyRule) to create a rule that requires <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> to verify users when they enroll a new authenticator. Create your own `POST` request body or copy the [example request](#okta-account-management-policy-rule-example-request) and input your values.

Ensure that youâ€™ve created a user account and group for that user. For example, add the user to a group called "<StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> IDV test group".

> **Note:** To add a rule using the Admin Console, see [Edit the Okta account management policy](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-edit-oamp).

1. [Retrieve the Okta account management policy ID](/docs/guides/okta-account-management-policy/main/#retrieve-the-okta-account-management-policy-id). Use the Okta account management policy `id` as the `policyId` value in your `POST` request to create the IDV rule.

1. Set the following request body parameters for the new IDV rule that you want to create:

   * Provide a `name` value.
   * Use the Okta account management policy `id` as the `policyId` value.
   * Set the group ID. Use the [List all groups call](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/openapi/okta-management/management/tag/Group/#tag/Group/operation/listGroups) to find the `id` for the test group.
   * Set the `verificationMethod` type to `ID_PROOFING`.
   * Set the `verificationMethod.id` as the ID of the <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> IdP that you created in the [previous section](#create-the-idv-vendor-in-okta).
   * Set `appSignOn` access value to `ALLOW`.
   * Use the following [Okta Expression Language](/docs/reference/okta-expression-language-in-identity-engine/) object:

    ```json
        "elCondition": {
            "condition": "accessRequest.operation == 'enroll'"
        }
    ```

    This expression requires users to verify their identity with the IDV vendor when they enroll a new authenticator.

1. Send the `POST /api/v1/policies/{policyId}/rules` request.

## Test the integration

After you've configured <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> as an IDV vendor and created the Okta account management policy rule, you can test the integration.

You can test the integration directly from your <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> app. However, you must use a real user account with verifiable user information. For example, if your IDV flow requires a government-issued ID, your user account must have an ID that matches that requirement.

1. Go to your <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> dashboard.
1. Go to **Helpdesk Verification**.
1. Under **Employee**, select the user you want to test the IDV flow with.
1. Under **Verification method**, select **Via sharing a Link**.
1. Click **Generate Verification & Copy Link**. The link is copied to your clipboard.
1. Paste the link into a new browser tab to open it.
1. Complete the IDV flow.

To verify that the Okta account management policy and <StackSnippet snippet="idp" inline /> are set up correctly in your org, try to enroll an authenticator with your user. If your IDV vendor and policy are set up correctly, that user is prompted to verify their identity with the IDV vendor before they can complete the enrollment.

> **Note:** Your user may not be able to complete the IDV flow if their information doesn't match the verifiable information required by your IDV vendor. Review the [System Log](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?id=ext_Reports_SysLog) if you encounter errors when testing the IDV flow. See [Identity verification events](/docs/guides/idv-integration/main/#identity-verification-events) for information about IDV events in the System Log.
