There are two steps to configure Incode as an IDV vendor in Okta:

1. At [Incode](https://workforce.incode.com/overview), follow these steps to create an Okta IDV integration: [Create Okta IDV Integration in Incode Workforce](https://workforce.developer.incode.com/docs/incode-okta-idv-configuration#step-1-create-okta-idv-integration-in-incode-workforce). Ensure that you copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values into a text editor. You need these values in the next section.
2. Then, integrate your user directory in Okta with Incode. Follow these steps to integrate your user directory in your Incode app: [Incode Directory Sync Integration with Okta IAM](https://workforce.developer.incode.com/docs/okta-service-app-api-integration). Use your test group ID when syncing your test group in your Incode app.
